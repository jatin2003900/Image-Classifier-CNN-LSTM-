# Image Captioning with CNN + LSTM (PyTorch)

This project demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to bridge the gap between computer vision and natural language processing. By combining a CNN encoder (ResNet-50) to extract meaningful visual features and an LSTM decoder to generate sequential text, the system learns to produce human-like captions for images.

The workflow starts with vocabulary building and tokenization, ensuring captions are processed into numerical form. The model is then trained using teacher forcing and optimized with cross-entropy loss, while evaluation is performed using BLEU scores to measure caption quality.

The repository is designed for both experimentation and reproducibility: it contains ready-to-use scripts for preprocessing, training, and inference, along with visualization outputs such as training loss curves, BLEU score progression, and example generated captions.

By running the included code, you can train on toy datasets for quick tests or scale up to widely used datasets such as Flickr8k, Flickr30k, or MSCOCO for more realistic captions. This makes the project a portfolio-ready showcase of multimodal AI skills, covering both computer vision and language generation.

python -m venv .venv
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/macOS:
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Data Preparation
1. Collect a dataset (e.g., **Flickr8k** or **MSCOCO**).  
2. Put all images under `data/images/`.  
3. Create a `data/captions.csv` file with columns:
   ```csv
   image_path,caption,split
   images/img1.jpg,A child in a pink dress is climbing stairs.,train
   images/img1.jpg,A little girl goes into a wooden building.,train
   images/img2.jpg,A dog is running through a grassy field.,val
   ```
4. Ensure `split` contains values: `train`, `val`, `test`.

## Train the Model
```bash
python src/train.py --captions data/captions.csv --images-root data --outdir outputs --epochs 10 --batch-size 64 --embed-dim 256 --hidden-dim 512 --min-freq 1 --max-len 20 --lr 1e-3
```

Outputs:
- `outputs/training_curves.png` → loss over epochs  
- `outputs/bleu_scores.png` → BLEU-4 progression  
- `outputs/best_captioner.pt` → best checkpoint  
- `outputs/vocab.json` → vocabulary file  

---

## Run Inference
```bash
python src/infer.py --checkpoint outputs/best_captioner.pt --vocab outputs/vocab.json --image data/images/example1.jpg --max-len 20
```

Example Output:
```
blue square with the word example1
```

## Results
- Training & validation loss curves  
- BLEU scores over epochs  
- Example generated captions  

---

## Next Steps
- Train longer (20+ epochs) for better captions  
- Use a larger dataset (Flickr30k, MSCOCO)  
- Try beam search decoding instead of greedy  
- Fine-tune CNN layers for better feature extraction
